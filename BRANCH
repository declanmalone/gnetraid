Info for the "Net-OnlineCode-0.04" branch

Preparation for 0.04 release of Net::OnlineCode
've made three major changes to the code since the 0.03 release:

* Changing to little-endian byte ordering in the RNG
* Using "Bones" to avoid a lot of array copies
* Replacing Fisher-Yates shuffle with Floyd's algorithm

Although I'm eventually going to replace the pure-Perl implementation
with a C/XS one, I'm not going to do that yet. I do want to make a new
release, though, to track the above changes.

I'll also be writing an OCD::Mapper package, which will require the
0.04 version of the code base.

Besides the changes above, I also have some to-dos before 0.04:

* Tidy up the code and comments
* Implement the same unrolled floyd as the C code (aux mapping)
* Write POD section for Net::OnlineCode::Bones
* See if I can squeeze out any more performance gains on the Raspberry
  Pi
