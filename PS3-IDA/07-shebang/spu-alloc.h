// Aligned malloc routine
//
// The strategy is simply to allocate a block with malloc that's align
// bytes larger than the required size and to round the returned
// memory address up to align bytes. Since the original address needs
// to be used for the corresponding free call, the caller must pass
// pointers to two variable: one for the aligned memory address, the
// other to pass to free() when the memory is to be released.
//
// As with most other implementations, this assumes that align is a
// power of 2.
//
// Return value is 0 for success, -1 and errno set otherwise.

int malloc_aligned(unsigned size, unsigned align,
