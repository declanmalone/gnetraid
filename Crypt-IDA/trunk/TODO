TODO items

* investigate bug calculating chunk sizes when width parameter != 1
  (this is clearly evident when called from ida_split script, but
  may not always arise when calling sf_split method)

* extend file format to enable storage of SHA-1 hashes for both shares
  (excluding header data) and original file. The easiest place to put
  these hashes is at the end of the file since it can be fairly easily
  incorporated into the {CLOSE} callbacks for stream handlers, it 
  doesn't require seeking backwards in the file, and it breaks less
  of the existing code since it shouldn't require extending the header.

* ideally the above would employ threads to enable asynchronous calc-
  ulation of hashes so that throughput is not too badly affected.

* update scripts/modules to use '-' as an alias for stdin/stdout
  if there isn't already an analogous way of doing this (I want this
  for quicker comparison of the results of sf_combine with an existing
  file; at present I have to extract the file and then compare two files
  as separate steps, meaning I have to read one file twice).

* allow passing in specific filenames to sf_split as an alternative to
  using the existing filespec-based naming scheme.
