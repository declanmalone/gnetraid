sub sf_combine {

  # Combining files is complicated by two issues:
  #
  # * Given a list of files, we don't know anything about which files
  #   are supposed to belong to which chunk, so we would need to read
  #   through the file headers to determine the chunk_start,
  #   chunk_next values and use these to group the files.
  # * The file format allows for omission of the transform data, so we
  #   have to support having a key or transform matrix passed to us
  #   for each chunk.
  #
  # The simplest solution to the first problem is to place
  # responsibilty for identifying which files go together to form a
  # complete chunk on the user. This should not be too onerous a task,
  # since the sf_split routine allows the caller to store the share
  # number and chunk number in each output filename. It also returns
  # the names of the sharefiles for each chunk.
  #
  # That still leaves the problem of passing in a key or transform
  # matrix and a row list (to associate each share with a particular
  # row of the transform matrix). The problem isn't so much with being
  # able to support this method of operation (since ida_combine
  # already supports it), but with coming up with a calling convention
  # which won't be overly complex.
  #
  # Note that the this issue of the key/transform matrix being stored
  # outside the file highlights a potential problem with the file
  # format. Namely, if the transform data isn't stored in the file,
  # there's nothing within the file itself to indicate which row of
  # the transform matrix the share corresponds to. The filename itself
  # should provide this data, but if the contents of the file are
  # transmitted and the filename gets lost or changed, then there's a
  # possibility that the person combining the files will have
  # problems. There are two solutions to this: either the split
  # routine incorporates a share number within the header, or it's up
  # to the central issuing authority (Dealer) to, eg, store a hash of
  # each share and the associated row number for that share in the
  # same database it uses to store the key/transform matrix. Partly
  # because there are solutions, but mostly because I don't think that
  # the centrally-stored key/transform matrix idea is a very good one,
  # I don't feel inclined to change the current file format to include
  # row numbers in the header. At least not for the time being.
  #
  # Getting back to the issue at hand, namely the calling convention,
  # it seems that the best solution would be keep the options here
  # as close as possible to the ones accepted by ida_combine. The two
  # differences are:
  #
  # * instead of fillers and an emptier, we handle infiles and an
  #   outfile
  #
  # * since we might need to handle multiple chunks, but ida_combine
  #   only operates on a single set of shares, we should either accept
  #   an array of options (one for each chunk) or only operate on
  #   one chunk at a time. I'll go with the latter option since it
  #   doesn't place much extra work (if any) on the calling program
  #   and it probably makes it less error-prone since the user doesn't
  #   have to remember to pass an array rather than a list of options.
  #   Having finer granularity might help the caller with regards to
  #   handling return values and error returns, too.

=head1 NAME

Crypt::IDA::ShareFile - Archive file format for Crypt::IDA module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Crypt::IDA::ShareFile ":default";
 
  @list  = sf_split( ... );
  $bytes = sf_combine ( ... );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a file format for creating, storing and
distributing shares created with Crypt::IDA. Created files contain
share data and (by default) the corresponding transform matrix row
used to split the input file. This means that share files are (again,
by default) stand-alone and may recombined later without needing any
other stored key or the involvement of the original issuer.

In addition to creating a number of shares, the module can also handle
breaking the input file into several chunks before processing, in a
way similar to multi-volume PKZIP, ARJ or RAR archives. Each of the
chunks may be split into shares using a different transform matrix.
Individual groups of chunks may be re-assembled independently, as they
are collected, and the quorum for each is satisfied.

=head2 EXPORT

No methods are exported by default. All methods may be called by
prefixing the method names with the module name, eg:

 $foo=Crypt::IDA::ShareFile::sf_split(...)

Alternatively, routines can be exported by adding ":default" to the
"use" line, in which case the routine names do not need to be prefixed
with the module name, ie:

  use Crypt::IDA::ShareFile ":default";
 
  $foo=Crypt::IDA::ShareFile::sf_split(...)
  # ...

Some extra ancillary routines can also be exported with the ":extras"
(just the extras) or ":all" (":extras" plus ":default") parameters to
the use line. See the section L<ANCILLARY ROUTINES> for details.

=head1 SPLIT OPERATION

The template for a call to C<sf_split>, showing all possible inputs
and default values, is as follows:

 @list=sf_split(
	 shares => undef,
	 quorum => undef,
	 width => 1,
	 filename => undef,
	 # supply a key, a matrix or neither
	 key => undef,
	 matrix => undef,
	 # misc options
	 version => 1,		# header version
	 rand => "/dev/urandom",
	 bufsize => 4096,
	 save_transform => 1,
         # chunking methods; pick one at most
	 n_chunks => undef,
	 in_chunk_size => undef,
	 out_chunk_size => undef,
	 out_file_size => undef,
	 # allow creation of a subset of shares, chunks
	 sharelist => undef,	# [ $row1, $row2, ... ]
	 chunklist => undef,	# [ $chunk1, $chunk2, ... ]
	 # specify pattern to use for share filenames
	 filespec => undef,	# default value set later on
   );

The minimal set of inputs is:

 @list=sf_split(
	 shares => $number_of_shares,
	 quorum => $quorum_value,
	 filename => "filename",
   );

The function returns a list of
C<[$key,$mat,$bytes_read,@output_files]> listrefs corresponding to
each chunk that was created, or undef in the case of an error.

The C<n_chunks>, C<in_chunk_size>, C<out_chunk_size> and
C<out_file_size> options allow control over how (or if) the input file
is broken into chunks. At most one of these options may be specified.
The C<n_chunks> option divides the input into the specified number of
chunks, which will be of (more-or-less) equal size.

The filespec option allows control over naming of output files. By
default this is set to '%f-%c-%s.sf' when a file is being split into
several chunks, or '%f-%s.sf' where no chunking is performed. Before
creating the output files, the '%f', '%c' and '%s' patterns are
replaced by:

=over

=item %f: input file name

=item %c: chunk number

=item %s: share number

=back

If an error is encountered during the creation of one set of shares in
a multi-chunk job, then the routine returns immediately without
attempting to split any other remaining chunks.

=head1 COMBINE OPERATION

The template for a call to C<sf_combine>, showing all possible inputs
and default values, is as follows:

 $bytes_read = sf_split (
     infiles => undef,		# [ $file1, $file2, ... ]
     outfile => undef,		# "filename"
     # If specified, the following must agree with the values stored
     # in the sharefiles. There's normally no need to set these.
     quorum => undef,
     width => undef,
     # optional matrix, key parameters
     key => undef,
     matrix => undef,
     shares => undef,		# required if key supplied
     sharelist => undef,	# required if key supplied
     # misc options
     bufsize => 4096,
    );

The minimal set of inputs is:

 $bytes_written = sf_combine (
     infiles => [ $file1, $file2, ... ],
     outfile => $output_filename
 );

The return value is the number of bytes written to the output file or
null in the case of some error.

The current version of the module only supports combining a single
chunk with each call to C<ida_combine>. Apart from being used in the
call to open the input file, the routine does not examine the input
filenames at all since all information necessary to combine the file
is expected to be contained within the files themselves (along with
any key/matrix parameters passed in, in the case where this
information is not stored in the file itself).

Chunks may be combined in any order. When the final chunk is
processed, if any any padding bytes were added to it during the
C<sf_split> routine, these will be removed by truncating the output
file.

=head1 ANCILLARY ROUTINES

The extra routines are exported by using the ":extras" or ":all"
parameter with the initial "use" module line. The extra routines are
as follows:

 $filename = sf_sprintf_filename($format,$infile,$chunk,$share);

This routine creates share file names from the given parameters. It is
used internally by C<sf_split>.

 @chunk_info=sf_calculate_chunk_sizes(
      quorum => undef,
      width => undef,
      filename => undef,
      # misc options
      version => 1,		# header version
      save_transform => 1,	# whether to store transform in header
      # chunking method: pick at most one
      n_chunks => undef,
      in_chunk_size => undef,
      out_chunk_size => undef,
      out_file_size => undef,
 );

This returns a list of hashrefs containing information about chunk
sizes, ranges, etc., with one element for each chunk which would be
created with the given parameters. All input values match those which
would be passed to C<sf_split> except for the C<save_transform> value,
which specifies whether the transform matrix row for each share should
be stored within the file header. Each hash in the returned list has
the following keys:

=over

=item * chunk_start  first byte of chunk

=item * chunk_next   first byte of next chunk

=item * chunk_size   chunk_next - chunk_start

=item * file_size    share file size, including header

=item * opt_final    is the last chunk in the file?

=item * padding      number of padding bytes in (final) chunk

=back

This routine is used internally by C<sf_split> to calculate chunk
sizes. It is available for calling routines since it may be useful to
know in advance how large output files will be before any shares are
created, such as for cases where there is limited space (eg, network
share or CD image) for creation of those output shares.

=head1 KEY MANAGEMENT

Provided the default settings are used, created sharefiles will have
all the information necessary to reconstruct the file once sufficient
shares have been collected. For systems where an alternative scheme is
required, see the discussion in the L<Crypt::IDA> man page.

=head1 TECHNICAL DETAILS

=head2 File Format

Each share file consists of a header and some share data. For the
current version of the file format (version 1), the header format is
as follows:

  Bytes   Name           Value
  2       magic          marker for "Share File" format; "SF" = {5346}
  1       version        file format version = 1
  1       options        options bits (see below)
  1-2     k,quorum       quorum k-value
  1-2     s,security     security level (ie, field width, in bytes)
  var     chunk_start    absolute offset of chunk in file
  var     chunk_next     absolute offset of next chunk in file
  var     transform      transform matrix row (optional)

All values stored in the header file (and the share data) are stored
in network (big-endian) byte order.

The options bits are as follows:

  Bit     name           Settings
  0       opt_large_k    Large (2-byte) k value?
  1 	  opt_large_w    Large (2-byte) w value?
  2 	  opt_final      Final chunk in file? (1=full file/final chunk)
  3 	  opt_transform  Is transform data included?

All file offsets are stored in a variable-width format. They are
stored as the concatenation of two values:

=over

=item * the number of bytes required to store the offset, and

=item * the actual file offset.

=back

So, for example, the offset "0" would be represented as the single
byte "0", while the offset 0x4321 would be represented as the hex
bytes "02", "43", "21".

Note that the chunk_next field is 1 greater than the actual offset of
the chunk end. In other words, each chunk ranges from the byte starting
at chunk_start up to, but not including the byte at chunk_next. That's
why it's called chunk_next rather than chunk_end.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The current implementation is limited to handling input files less
than 4Gb in size. This is merely a limitation of the current header
handling code, and this restriction may by removed in a later version.

Currently, the only chunking options available are for no chunking or
for chunking a file into a given number of chunks (with n_chunks
option).

=head1 FUTURE VERSIONS

It is possible that the following changes/additions will be made in
future versions:

=over

=item * implement a routine to scan given list of input files and
group them into batches that can be passed to C<sf_combine> (as well
as weeding out sub-quorum batches and broken, overlapping or
non-compliant files);

=item * implement a file format that can keep track of created
sharefiles along with parameters used to create them;

=item * implement encryption of input data stream along with dispersed
storage of decryption key in share files;

=item * implement a cryptographic accumulator to eliminate the
possibility of a cheater presenting an invalid share at the combine
stage;

=item * implement regular checksum/hash to detect damage to share
data;

=item * implement storing a row number with shares in the case where
the transform data for that share is not stored in the sharefile
header;

=item * implement a scatter/gather function to disperse shares over
the network and download (some of) them again to reconstitute the file
(probably in a new module);

=item * implement a network-based peer protocol which allows peers
with the same file to co-ordinate key generation so that they can
generate compatible shares and also share the burden of ShareFile
creation and distribution (long-term goal)

=item * I'm open to suggestions on any of these features or any other
feature that anybody might want ...
