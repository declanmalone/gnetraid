Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::IDA.


0.02  2019
        - 10th Year Anniversary Edition! (following Math-FastGF2)
	- Generally speaking, no difference in functionality
        - New, simplified internal handling of main split/combine loops
	  * differentiate the two instead of having one generic loop
	  * eliminate expensive calls to offset_to_rowcol
	  * aim for speed and clarity
	- Suppress warnings about redefined methods in recent perl
          versions
	- Deprecate call that constructs matrix based on "key"
	  * Code moved to Math::FastGF2::Matrix (old call still works)
	  * Also added method to create Cauchy inverse matrix there
        X New "dumb" or "close to the metal" interfaces [deferred]
	  * avoids needing to use filler/emptier callbacks
	  * user handles filling/emptying matrices themselves
	  * less error checking overheads
	  * (above simplified internal routines satisfy this for now)
	  * better support for non-blocking I/O
        X New C program: rabin-ida-helper [deferred]
	  * intended to offload bulk matrix multiplications
	  * replaces calls to Math::FastGF2::Matrix::multiply_submatrix_c
	  * runs as a child process
	  * mini command interpreter to read config from stdin
	  * range of I/O stream options (file, fifo or socket, pipe
	    or fd provided by parent)
	  * progress reporting (assumes we're working inside an event
            loop or multi-process context)
	X More flexible/featureful sharefile headers [deferred]
	  * optional field: cheating prevention (so silo can't present
	    an invalid share without being detected; based on
	    cryptographic accumulators and other ideas)
	  * optional field: (share of) hash of combined file
          * optional field: (share of) Cauchy "key"
	  * allow implementor to decide if silos are trusted (above
            fields can be replicated) or not (fields are shared and
            might have extra safeguards when combining)
	X Use Unix extended attributes to store some metadata [deferred]
	  * an implementation detail
	  * alternative to storing some metadata in headers
