Revision history for Perl extension Math::FastGF2.

0.07  Fri 13 Sep 2019
      - Fix problem with C routine not returning a value in all
        cases (stops compilation with error in C99)
      - Slightly improve(?) multiply_submatrix_c for most common
        calling case (w=1, input/output matrices in ROWWISE/COLWISE or
        COLWISE/ROWWISE organisation)
      - Turn offset_to_rowcol into an xsub (profiling showed it was
        very expensive; a better solution would be to eliminate the
        need to call it altogether...)
      - new getvals_str and setvals_str XS subs that do same kind of
        sanity checking as getvals/setvals, but only works with
        strings (gives a big performance improvement)

      - Fix Cauchy.t to pass tests if Crypt::IDA is not available
        (problem discovered via CPAN testers)

0.05  Sat 17 Aug 2019
      - 10th anniversary special release!!!
      - New constructor for Cauchy Matrix generated from a list
	of x1,x2,...xn,y1,..yk values (moved from Crypt::IDA)
      - New, slightly more efficient Matrix inversion method for
	Cauchy matrices (called as constructor given above x1..yk)
      - New constructor for Vandermonde matrix (x1..xn)
      - New $matrix->print method (pretty!)
      - Don't warn if modules "use"d twice
      - Profiling-driven speed improvements and some code cleanup
	* One of my main reasons to revisit the code.
	* See Changes-0.5 for more details.

0.04  Mon Aug 17 21:00:00 2009
      - Add copy/flip-related Matrix code
      - More tests on getvals/setvals
      - Remove some unused code that was causing compilation errors
	on some platforms.
      - Documentation updates
      - Downgrade version of perl required to version 5.6. I have
	not personally tested this version, but I've no reason to
	suspect any problems. I will keep an eye out for test
	reports on this, though.

0.03  Fri Aug 14 22:50:00 2009
      - New release. Attempt to automatically determine the correct
	C data types for 16 and 32-bit values. This should simplify
	the task of setting up the software on different platforms.
	If the determination of types doesn't succeed the
	Makefile.PL script exits with a useful error message and
	error code 0 before writing a Makefile, so this should at
	least handle the problem gracefully and not raise a FAIL
	test result.

0.02  Fri Aug 14 18:00:00 2009
      - New release. Add Matrix code.
      - All installable perl scripts now go in bin/ where they
	belong.
      - Make building of XS code depend on perlsubs.c
      - Automated tests by CPAN testers are failing because of
	different sizes for "unsigned long". A future release will
	try to determine the correct word size at compile time.
	Until then, if the system tests fail with code 11 (segfault)
	on systems with 64-bit native ints, please manually change
	the type of gf2_u32 to something appropriate and also update
	the Perl XS functions (and prototypes) to use the same
	value. Thank you.
