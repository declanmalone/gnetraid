App-OCD-Mapper

This package includes the App::OCD::Mapper module and some scripts
that use it. The Mapper module calls Net::OnlineCode modules to either
generate or parse a simple "map" file. Map files contain various
metadata (input file name, check block file name, codec parameters)
along with a list of how check, auxiliary or message blocks are
composed in terms of other blocks (ie, the map).

App::OCD::Mapper basically provides a convenient file format for
encapsulating data relating to either the encoding or decoding (or
both) of a file using the Online Code algorithm. 

Map files are intended to decouple the higher level aspects of the
Online Code algorithm from the low-level block- or network-oriented
operations.  Several example programs are included that operate on map
files:

* an encoder program that reads in the map file and an input file and
  produces a check block file
* a decoder program that reads in the map file and a check block file
  to recover the original file
* a network sender program that reads blocks from the check block file
  and sends them out on a multicast channel at a given rate
* a receiver program that receives check blocks from the network,
  saves them to a check block file, runs the OC decoding algorithm and
  outputs a decoding map file
