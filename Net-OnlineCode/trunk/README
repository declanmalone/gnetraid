Net::OnlineCode

This module implements "Online Codes", a form of "rateless" forward
error correction.  Unlike optimal error-correcting codes such as
Reed-Solomon codes, Online Codes differ in certain respects:

* They can send a practically infinite number of check blocks (ie,
  they are "rateless") without needing to determine the network packet
  loss rate in advance.

* They are near-optimal (meaning that a certain percentage extra
  blocks need to be sent for the original message to be decoded)

* Encoding and decoding takes linear time (as opposed to, say RS
  codes, which can take time proportional to O(n(log n))

Taken together, this set of qualities makes Online Codes very suitable
for transmission of data in a multicast or multi-sender network.
