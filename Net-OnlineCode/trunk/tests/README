Extended Tests for Net::OnlineCode packages

These tests are not that well suited for the regular Perl installation
tests, so I'm splittng them out here. These scripts are set up to be
run from this directory. If you want to run them from elsewhere and
have not yet installed the packages, you will need to use perl's -I
flag to tell it where to find the libraries, eg:

 $ perl -I/path/to/Net/OnlineCode/lib <scriptname>
