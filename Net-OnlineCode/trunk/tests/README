Extended Tests for Net::OnlineCode packages

These tests are not that well suited for the regular Perl installation
tests, so I'm splittng them out here. These scripts are set up to be
run from this directory. If you want to run them from elsewhere and
have not yet installed the packages, you will need to use perl's -I
flag to tell it where to find the libraries, eg:

 $ perl -I/path/to/Net/OnlineCode/lib <scriptname>


I also had a problem running the scripts here if I had an old version
of the libraries installed, eg:

 Net::OnlineCode object version 0.02 does not match bootstrap
 parameter 0.03 at /usr/lib/perl/5.14/DynaLoader.pm line 207.

I wasn't able to track down the source of the problem, but installing
the new version of the library made the problem go away.

Stuff that is here (including args):

* bipartite.pl

  Deprecated testing script

* mindecoder.pl [mblocks=2]

  Minimal decoder script. Just solves the graph. Displays:

  checkblock number (done flag): which nodes were solved by this block

* promises.pl [-d | -s seed] [mblocks=100] [trials=1]

  Tests claims made in the original paper. Normally uses a random seed, but
  this can be overridden with options:

  -d       uses a "deterministic" seed value (all nulls)

  -s seed  you specify the seed value

* probdist.pl

  Shows some info about probability distribution tables and e, q and F
  values for some different parameters.

* codec.pl [blocksize=4] [seed]

  Full coder/decoder test. Uses a small string and passes it through both
  then displays the decoded output

* smoker.pl [blocksize=20]

  Calls codec.pl for a fixed number of trials and reports any trials that
  don't display the correct output. Prints the seed value for failure
  cases.

* rng.pl

  Does a basic statistical test on the output of the RNG object to
  test the quality of the generated random numbers.

* fisher-yates.pl

  Basic tests on Fisher-Yates shuffle routine in Net::OnlineCode
