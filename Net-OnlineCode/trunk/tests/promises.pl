# Test promises made by paper regarding how many checkblocks should be
# needed to recover the message.
#
# n  = number of message blocks
# n' = number of message blocks plus auxiliary blocks
#
# There are three distinct promises made in the paper:
#
# 1) knowing a (1 - e/2) fraction of all the composite blocks (n') should
#    be enough to decode the full message. This may fail to be true
#    with probability (e/2) ** (q+1)
#
# 2) any set of (1 + e) * n' check blocks should be enough to recover
#    the above (1-e/2) fraction of all composite blocks. No error
#    probability is given with this
#
# 3) any set of (1 + 3e)n check blocks should be sufficient to recover
#    the message "with a high degree of probability". It is unclear to
#    me where this constant value 3 comes from.  It seems to me that
#    perhaps it should be "q" instead.
#

# Two optional arguments:
#
# -d         Use a default/deterministic seed value (160 zero bits)
# -s seed    Use a user-supplied seed (overrides -d)
#
# These seed values apply to the first trial. Any successive trials
# will continue to use the existing RNG so each trial will generate
# different values but overall the results will be the same across
# different runs.
