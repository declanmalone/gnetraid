# Implements a data structure for decoding the bipartite graph (not
# needed for encoding). Note that this does not store Block IDs or any
# actual block data and, consequently, does not do any XORs. Those
# tasks are left to the calling object/programs. The reason for this
# separation is to allow us to focus here on the graph algorithm
# itself and leave the implementation details (ie, synchronising the
# random number generator and storing and XORing blocks) to the user.

# Simple low-level operations to improve readability (and allow for
# single debugging points)

# Rather than referring to left and right neighbours, I used the
# ordering of the array and higher/lower to indicate the relative
# positions of check, auxiliary and message blocks, respectively. The
# ordering is:
#
#   message < auxiliary < check	
#
# Using this ordering, message blocks are "lower" than auxiliary and
# check blocks and vice-versa. Equivalently, message blocks have no
# "lower" nodes and check blocks have no "higher" nodes, while
# auxiliary blocks have both.
#
# This can be used as a mnemonic: there is nothing lower than message
# blocks since without them, the sender would not be able to construct
# auxiliary or check blocks and the receiver would not be able to
# receive anything. Equivalently, think of aux and check blocks as
# "higher-level" constructs moving "up" the software stack.
